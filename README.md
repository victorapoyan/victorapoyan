Hi, my name is Victor, I'm 3 years old Android developer ðŸ‘¶. I was born in Armenia ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡², but currently living in ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª. I start development shortly after I was born. First, it was **C** then **C++** then **Objective-C** then **Embedded C** after **Java** and now it's **Kotlin**, what will be the next I don't know, but for sure it will be something which brings me a lot of fun.


I have a simple idea, which is **Sharing of the knowledge** which I accumulate during past years, by developing with you an **Android** applications and explaining each and every line and by using different technics and technologies. 


I guess this will be an awesome collaboration, where we both will learn from each other.
