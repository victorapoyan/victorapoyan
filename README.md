## Hi There <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">

My name is Victor. I am Android Developer ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡². My passions are Mobile applications and Blockchain technologies. I love to write clean, tested, and readable code. Less code, fewer bugs. For the past years, I learned a lot and never stop learning, every new day is an opportunity to learn something new. Why I choose Android as my passion as it's free and open-source and 'every' human on this planet has access to the chip android device on which is running my application.


Success is a journey, not a destination, join my journey and let's make the world a better place for us.
